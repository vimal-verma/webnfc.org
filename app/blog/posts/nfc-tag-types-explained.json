    "content": "<p>Not all NFC tags are created equal. The NFC Forum has defined five official tag types, each with different capabilities. Understanding them helps you appreciate the technology inside your <a href=\"/products\">NFC business card</a>. Let's break them down.</p><h3>Type 1 Tags</h3><p>Based on the ISO-14443A standard, Type 1 tags are simple and cost-effective. They typically have 96 bytes of memory, which is enough for a simple URL, but their low cost makes them suitable for disposable uses. [8]</p><h3>Type 2 Tags</h3><p>Also based on ISO-14443A, Type 2 tags are the most common type used for business cards, including our popular NTAG series. [2, 6] They offer a great balance of cost and performance, with memory typically ranging from 48 bytes to 2 kilobytes, and are perfect for storing contact details (vCards) or website links. [2]</p><h4>A Closer Look: NTAG213 vs. NTAG215 vs. NTAG216</h4><p>The NTAG21x series from NXP is the industry standard for Type 2 tags. While they share core features like 10-year data retention and a 100,000 write cycle endurance, their primary difference is user memory, which affects how much data they can hold. [2, 3]</p><table ><thead><tr><th >Chip</th><th >User Memory</th><th >Use Case</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td ><strong>NTAG213</strong></td><td >144 bytes</td><td >The most common and versatile chip. Perfect for storing URLs, short text, or triggering simple actions. [2, 6]</td></tr><tr><td ><strong>NTAG215</strong></td><td >504 bytes</td><td >Ideal for storing more detailed information, like a digital business card (vCard) with multiple fields. Famously used for Nintendo Amiibo figures. [2, 18]</td></tr><tr><td ><strong>NTAG216</strong></td><td >888 bytes</td><td >Offers the largest capacity for complex data, such as extensive vCards or small amounts of stored data for specific applications, though it comes at a higher cost. [2, 6, 18]</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>Note: While NTAG214 is sometimes mentioned, it is not a standard chip in this series, and specifications for it are inconsistent. For most applications, NTAG213, 215, and 216 are the go-to choices.</em></p><h3>Type 3 Tags</h3><p>Based on Sony's FeliCa™ standard, Type 3 tags are faster and have more memory than Types 1 and 2. [2, 5] They are predominantly used in Asia for complex systems like public transportation tickets and e-money applications. [5]</p><h3>Type 4 Tags</h3><p>Type 4 tags are compatible with both ISO-14443A and B standards. They offer larger memory capacities (up to 32KB) and have more advanced security features. [2, 8] This makes them suitable for applications that require higher security, such as access control systems. [5]</p><h3>Type 5 Tags</h3><p>The newest addition, Type 5 tags operate on the ISO/IEC 15693 standard. Their main advantage is a longer read range compared to the other types, which makes them ideal for industrial applications like supply chain management and asset tracking. [5, 6]</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>While each tag type has its purpose, Type 2 tags provide the perfect combination of memory, speed, and cost-effectiveness for the vast majority of consumer applications, including making your NFC business card a powerful networking tool. All these tags are programmed using NDEF (NFC Data Exchange Format) records, which is the standardized way to structure the data you share. [15]</p>"
