    "content": "<h3>Introduction</h3><p>You've probably heard the terms RFID and NFC, sometimes used interchangeably. While they are related, they serve very different purposes. NFC is a specialized subset of RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification), but key differences make each unique.</p><h3>What is RFID?</h3><p>RFID uses radio waves to identify objects remotely. An RFID system consists of a tag (with a chip and antenna) and a reader. Tags can be 'passive' (powered by the reader's signal) or 'active' (with their own battery). RFID is a powerhouse for logistics, capable of scanning hundreds of tags per second from several meters away, making it perfect for tracking inventory in a warehouse.</p><h3>What is NFC?</h3><p>NFC, or Near Field Communication, is a high-frequency branch of RFID. As the name implies, it's designed for communication over a very short distance—just a few centimeters. This intentional limitation is a key security feature.</p><h3>Key Differences</h3><ul><li><strong>Range:</strong> This is the biggest differentiator. RFID systems can operate over many meters, whereas NFC is limited to about 10cm. This makes NFC secure for payments, as you have to intentionally bring your device close to the reader.</li><li><strong>Communication:</strong> RFID is typically a one-way street, where a reader pulls an ID from a tag. NFC, however, supports two-way communication. This allows an NFC-enabled device like a smartphone to act as both a reader (scanning a tag) and a tag (emulating a payment card).</li><li><strong>Frequency:</strong> RFID operates across low, high, and ultra-high frequencies. NFC is standardized to operate only in the high-frequency (HF) band at 13.56 MHz.</li><li><strong>Use Case:</strong> RFID excels at long-range, bulk scanning like tracking inventory or livestock. NFC shines in secure, one-to-one interactions like contactless payments, transit passes, and digital business cards.</li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Think of RFID as a loudspeaker shouting IDs across a warehouse, and NFC as a secure, private whisper between two devices held closely together. For the personal, secure, and intentional act of sharing your professional identity, NFC is the clear and superior choice.</p>"
