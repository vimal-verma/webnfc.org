    "content": "<h3>Introduction to NFC Tag Types</h3><p>Not all NFC tags are created equal. The NFC Forum has defined five official tag types, each with different capabilities, memory, and speed. Understanding them helps you choose the right tag for your project.</p><h3>Type 1 Tags</h3><p>Based on the ISO-14443A standard, Type 1 tags are simple and cost-effective. They typically have 96 bytes of memory, which is enough for a simple URL, but their low cost makes them suitable for disposable uses.</p><h3>Type 2 Tags</h3><p>Also based on ISO-14443A, Type 2 tags are the most common type for consumer applications like business cards and marketing. They offer a great balance of cost and performance, with memory typically ranging from 48 bytes to 2 kilobytes, perfect for storing contact details (vCards) or website links.</p><h4>Common Type 2 Chips: NTAG Series</h4><p>The NTAG21x series from NXP is the industry standard for Type 2 tags. Their primary difference is user memory:</p><ul><li><strong>NTAG213:</strong> 144 bytes of user memory. Great for URLs and short text.</li><li><strong>NTAG215:</strong> 504 bytes of user memory. Ideal for vCards or more detailed data. Famously used for Nintendo Amiibo.</li><li><strong>NTAG216:</strong> 888 bytes of user memory. Offers the largest capacity for complex data.</li></ul><h3>Type 3 Tags</h3><p>Based on Sony's FeliCa™ standard, Type 3 tags are faster and have more memory than Types 1 and 2. They are predominantly used in Asia for complex systems like public transportation tickets and e-money applications.</p><h3>Type 4 Tags</h3><p>Type 4 tags are compatible with both ISO-14443A and B standards. They offer larger memory capacities (up to 32KB) and have more advanced security features, making them suitable for applications that require higher security, such as access control systems.</p><h3>Type 5 Tags</h3><p>The newest addition, Type 5 tags operate on the ISO/IEC 15693 standard. Their main advantage is a longer read range compared to the other types, which makes them ideal for industrial applications like supply chain management and asset tracking.</p>"
